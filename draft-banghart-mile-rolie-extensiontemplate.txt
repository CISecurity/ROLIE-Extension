1.  Introduction

   {This document is a template guide for the creation of ROLIE
   extensions.  Each section in this document represents a section that
   could appear in a ROLIE extension.  Each section will describe
   itself, as well as the criteria under which it should appear in the
   document.  All extensions should adhere to the section numbers and
   the ordering of the sections in this template, this way section
   number references are consistent across extensions.  Likewise, anchor
   values should remain consistent with the anchor values used in this
   template.}

   {Text inside of curly brackets is template commentary, and should be
   removed when writing the extension.}

   {The introduction section is important when defining a ROLIE
   extension.  The introduction should define what the extension intends
   to add to ROLIE as unambiguously as possible.  The section should
   cover what use cases the extension intends to address, or in other

   words, the "why" of the extension.  The more detail provided here the
   less confusion there will be over what the extension does.}

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST," "MUST NOT," "REQUIRED," "SHALL," "SHALL NOT,"
   "SHOULD," "SHOULD NOT," "RECOMMENDED," "MAY," and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Definitions for some of the common computer security-related
   terminology used in this document can be found in Section 2 of
   [RFC5070].

   {Several placeholders are used throughout this document, to be
   replaced by the appropriate values when the extension is written.
   These placeholders are:

      extension-name : This should be replaced by the name of the
      extension.  This value is fairly flexible, and is used in prose
      text.

      ext-prefix : This should be replace by the chosen prefix of the
      extension.  This should be a short, unique prefix to identify the
      extension in the ROLIE namespace.

      information-type : This should be replaced with the normative name
      of an information type.  Documents may have multiple information
      types defined, in which case this placeholder may have multiple
      valid values.}

   {Any other text inside of square brackets ([]) is intended to be
   placeholder text to be substituted by the extension author.}

3.  Additional Requirements for the Atom Publishing Protocol

   {This section lists any additional requirements imposed on the Atom
   Publication Protocol when a repository is implementing or utilizing
   the extension.  This includes both protocol requirements as well as
   format requirements on the Service and Category Documents.  As with
   previous sections, this section must appear in the document, but may
   specify that no additional requirements are imposed.  Note that the
   three sub-sections given below are examples and guidelines,
   additional sections may be needed as appropriate.}

   This document does not specify any additional requirements for use of
   the Atom Publishing Protocol.

Internet-Draft                    ROLIE                   September 2017


   This document specifies the following requirements for use of the
   Atom Publishing Protocol.

3.1.  Use of HTTP requests

   {Provides additional requirements surrounding the handling of HTTP
   requests in APP.  This section should NOT appear in the document if
   there are no requirements}

3.2.  Requirements for the app:service element

   {Provides additional requirements surrounding the service document in
   APP.  This section should NOT appear in the document if there are no
   requirements}

3.3.  Requirements for the app:categories element

   {Provides additional requirements surrounding the category document
   in APP.  This section should NOT appear in the document if there are
   no requirements.}

4.  Additonal Requirements for the Atom Syndication Format

   {This section lays out any additional requirements imposed on the
   Atom Syndication Format.  As with previous sections, this section
   must appear in the document, but may specify that no additional
   requirements are imposed.  The sub-sections given below are not
   required to appear, but are given as examples.}

   This document does not specify any additional requirements on the
   Atom Syndication Format.

   This document specifies the following additional requirements for the
   Atom Syndication Format.

4.1.  Additonal Requirements for the atom:feed element

   {This section lays out additional requirements imposed on Atom
   Syndication Format feeds by this extension.  Any changes made to
   schema should be represented both here and in Appendix 1.}

4.2.  Additonal Requirements for the atom:entry element

   {This section lays out additional requirements imposed on Atom
   Syndication Format entries by this extension.  Any changes made to
   schema should be represented both here and in Appendix 1.}

5.  Information-type Extensions

   {This section should always appear in an extension.  If no
   information types are defined the first statement should be the only
   content in this section.  Multiple child sections may be used to
   describe multiple information types.}

   This document does not define any new information types.

   This document defines the following information type[s]:

5.1.  The "information-type" information type

   {A brief overview of the information type should be here.  Any terms
   used in this description should be carefully defined and described.
   A recommendation is to create a non-exhaustive list of what
   information in this category may achieve, or a list of example
   information that would fall into this category.  Avoid discussion of
   specific formats in this section, and focus on high level information
   concepts.  A list or description of what kinds of information this
   information type would not include may also be desirable.  The
   "information-type" part of the anchor should be replaced with the
   name of the information type.}

5.1.1.  Use of the rolie:format element

   {This section should be used to discuss the formats that are likely
   or possible to be used to convey this information type.  Specific
   information types can be listed if desired.  Example given below.}

   The information-type example format  {If present, this text should
      discuss the format in question.  It should make clear how this
      format would be used to convey the given information type, while
      making it clear that this format is not a requirement.  For more
      detailed information, a reference should be provided to the
      specification for this format, or some other static source of
      information.}

6.  rolie:property Extensions

   {This section defines the requirements around the use of the
   rolie:property element in Entries.  Additionally, this section should
   be used to discuss any new properties that are being registered by
   this extension.  An example is provided below.}

   {This section should always appear in the document, but may specify
   if there are no requirements}

Internet-Draft                    ROLIE                   September 2017


   This document does not register any new rolie:property names.

   This document registers new valid rolie:property names as follows:

6.1.  urn:ietf:params:rolie:property:ext-prefix:example

   {A detailed description of the property should be provided in this
   subsection.  It is important that detailed requirements are listed
   here that define what the expected value is of this property, and how
   that value is derived.  How the property is expected to be used, and
   in what cases the property is expected to appear is also valuable
   information.  The IANA registry will reference this section as its
   normative text.}

7.  atom:link Extensions

   {This section defines new link relationships.  Each relationship
   should be named,described, and given a requirement level.  A table or
   list structure is preferred.  An example is provided below.}

   {This section should always appear in the document, but may specify
   if there are no additional expected link relationships.}

   This document does not define any new link relationships.

   This document defines new valid link relationships as follows:

   +----------+---------------------------+----------------------------+
   | Name     | Description               | Conformance                |
   +----------+---------------------------+----------------------------+
   | rel-name | A brief description of    | A RFC 2119 normative word  |
   |          | what this link would      | to denote the              |
   |          | dereference to, and what  | implementation support     |
   |          | this uses this link       | requirement for this link  |
   |          | relationship has.         | relationship.              |
   +----------+---------------------------+----------------------------+

8.  Other Registered Extensions

   {This section should contain normative text around other registered
   extensions not covered by the other sections.  This could include
   other registered category values or extensions to related IANA
   tables.}

   {This section should always appear in the document, but may specific
   that there are no additional extensions.}

Internet-Draft                    ROLIE                   September 2017


   There are no additional extensions to define.

   This document defines additional extensions as follows:

9.  IANA Considerations

   {The IANA considerations section must always appear as per IETF
   standards.  Any registrations must be listed here following the
   registration rules laid out in the ROLIE core document.  Examples are
   provided below for the example information type and the example
   property laid out above.}

9.1.  information-type information-type

   IANA has added an entry to the "ROLIE Security Resource Information
   Type Sub-Registry" registry located at
   <https://www.iana.org/assignments/rolie/category/information-type> .

   The entry is as follows:

      name: information-type

      index: TBD

      reference: This document, Section 5.1

9.2.  ext-prefix:example property

   IANA has added an entry to the "ROLIE URN Parameters" registry
   located in <https://www.iana.org/assignments/rolie/>.

      name: property:ext-prefix:example

      Extension IRI: urn:ietf:params:rolie:property:ext-prefix:example

      Reference: This document, Section 6.1

      Subregistry: None

10.  Security Considerations

   {Much of the security considerations are covered in the ROLIE core
   security considerations section.  This section should cover the
   security considerations unique or especially important to the use
   cases covered by this extension.  The formats you expect to use, how
   properties are derived and displayed, additional link relationships,
   and any other new requirements can generate new security concerns.}

11.  Privacy Considerations

   {Similar to the security considerations above, much of the primary
   privacy considerations are covered in the ROLIE core.  Consider the
   unique privacy concerns involved in the use case covered by this
   extension.  Additional information exposed by new properties or an
   increased likelihood for this extension to be used in open-access
   public repositories are possible considerations. }

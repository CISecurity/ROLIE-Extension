            <t>{This document provides a template for the creation of
                ROLIE extension specifications. While intended as only
                guidance, any author intending to create a ROLIE
                extension should follow this template in order to ensure
                that extension registrations are accepted by the working
                group.}</t>

            <t>{This document is a template guide for the creation of
                ROLIE extensions. Each section in this document
                represents a section that could appear in a ROLIE
                extension. Each section will describe itself, as well as
                the criteria under which it should appear in the
                document. All extensions should adhere to the section
                numbers and the ordering of the sections in this
                template, this way section number references are
                consistent across extensions. Likewise, anchor values
                should remain consistent with the anchor values used in
                this template.}</t>
            <t>{Text inside of curly brackets is template commentary, and
                should be removed when writing the extension.} </t>
            <t>{The introduction section is important when defining a
                ROLIE extension. The introduction should define what the
                extension intends to add to ROLIE as unambiguously as
                possible. The section should cover what use cases the
                extension intends to address, or in other words, the
                "why" of the extension. The more detail provided here the
                less confusion there will be over what the extension
                does.}</t>

                "MAY," and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be

                <t> extension-name : This should be replaced by the name
                    of the extension. This value is fairly flexible, and
                    is used in prose text.</t>
                <t> ext-prefix : This should be replace by the chosen
                    prefix of the extension. This should be a short,
                    unique prefix to identify the extension in the ROLIE
                    namespace.</t>
                <t> information-type : This should be replaced with the
                    normative name of an information type. Documents may
                    have multiple information types defined, in which
                    case this placeholder may have multiple valid
                    values.}</t>
                </list></t>
            <t>{Any other text inside of square brackets ([]) is intended
                to be placeholder text to be substituted by the extension
                author.}</t>

                primary privacy considerations are covered in the ROLIE
                core. Consider the unique privacy concerns involved in
                the use case covered by this extension. Additional
                information exposed by new properties or an increased
                likelihood for this extension to be used in open-access
                public repositories are possible considerations. }</t>
